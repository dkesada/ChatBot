# ChatBot
This is an attempt at creating an engine for a simple chat bot in a reduced domain. The domain will be that of a real estate agency, so the questions asked to the chat bot will revolve around finding houses with some properties or in certain areas, and the documents where the bot is going to search for the answers will be short descriptions or tables with the details of the houses.

This project is part of a master thesis in Natural Language Generation (NLG), for a master degree in artificial inteligence from Universidad Politecnica de Madrid (UPM).
